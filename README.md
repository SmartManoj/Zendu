### This project is on a very early stage of development

# DainoGram
A Telegram client for Wear OS 3 (Galaxy Watch 4 ecc...)

This client uses a combo of TdLib and TdLights

What's working:
- Authentication
- Reloading the app without the needs of retrieving another auth. code
- Getting network messages (such as chats)

TODO:
- Almost everything
